# flappy_bird
Final project for reinforcement learning :D

### Environment
We used a premade environment from https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym with slight adjustments. 
  - Larger magnitude for bird gravity - this allows the gravity to overtake the up velocity and actually fall if it did not flap.
  - Reward function - this provides the agent with rewards for how close to the pipe gap the agent is
